This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm 
for an efficient data compression and decompression. 
The package includes modules for encoding text into Huffman
codes and decoding them back to their original form. 
This tool can significantly reduce the size of text data, 
making it ideal for applications in data transmission and storage.
******************************************************************
how to use it?
-use huffman_encoding.py tompress a text into 
binary format using Huffman coding
-use huffman_decoding.py to convert binary encoded data
back into its original text format using the Huffman tree
